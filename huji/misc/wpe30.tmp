    <li align="justify"><a href="fyi/fyi.zip">Four Your
        Information</a> displays a windows with some text in it
        and a Cancel and Continue button. The window Stays on Top.
        The message text can be either provided on the command
        line ore by a text file. An options command can be
        supplied that is run when the user clicks the Continue
        button. Used to give users a small message before running
        a program or simply output something to the user <a

        href="fyi/fyi.txt">Documentation</a>.</li>
    <li align="justify"><a href="diskfree/diskfree.zip">Disk-Free</a>
        runs a user-specified program when the free disk space on
        a specified drive is more (or less) than a specified
        value. Used to check the user's home directory and warn
        them if they will run out of space soon. See <a
        href="diskfree/diskfree.txt">Documentation</a> for more
        info and examples.</li>
    <li align="justify"><a href="exitwin/exitwin.zip">Exit
        Windows</a> is a small program to exit Windows in all
        kind of forms: Reboot, Shutdown, Logout, Force Mode etc.
        This program simply is a wrapper for the Win32 API
        ExitWindowsEx function and passes it's parameter to that
        API functions. Look at the <a
        href="exitwin/exitwin_pic.gif">Screen-shot</a> as
        documentation. I wrote this because all the Exit Windows
        programs I found on the Web where either bloated (just
        big or many unnecessary functions), needed VB****.DLL or
        even not Free-Ware !</li>
    <li align="justify"><a href="kreboot/kreboot.zip">Super-Strong
        Reboot</a> are two small programs that reboot the PC
        using the keyboard controller. Is just like Ctrl-Alt-Del
        under DOS. One program for immediate reboot and one for
        timed reboot with a countdown timer.<a
        href="kreboot/kreboot.txt">Documentation</a></li>
    <li align="justify"><a href="rds/rds.zip">Restore Default
        Settings</a> is a end-user program that helps the users
        to install default settings for various programs. Read
        the <a href="rds/rds.txt">Documentation</a> for further
        explanations.</li>
    <li align="justify"><a href="setwall/setwall.zip">Set
        Wallpaper</a> is a very small until that takes a bmp file
        as argument and sets it as desktop wallpaper (centered).
        I wrote this because I didn't find anything on the Web
        that does <b>just</b> this, so I wrote it (It's simply a
        wrapper to an Win32 API function).</li>
    <li align="justify"><a href="shellexecute/shellexecute.zip">Shell
        Execute</a> is a small program that wraps the Win32
        ShellExecuteEx API function. This is mostly like start.exe,
        but allows you to run files without a DOS windows popping
        up, interprets %..% environment variables etc.. <a
        href="shellexecute/shellexecute_pic.gif">Screen-shot of
        help screen</a></li>
    <li align="justify"><a href="regfix/regfix.zip">Fix Registry
        on boot</a> This prevents the &quot;Registry is damaged,
        do you want to restore it from the backup&quot; screen
        from appearing since it does the same task (and more). <a
        href="regfix/regfix.txt">ReadMe</a>. <a
        href="regfix/regfix.bat.txt">REGFIX.BAT</a>.</li>
    <li align="justify"><a href="resbrow/resbrow.zip">Restricted
        Browser</a> This is a Internet Explorer implementation
        that allows you to restrict the browsing behaviour. Ideal
        for public computers in kiosk mode. <a
