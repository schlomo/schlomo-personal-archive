1.	General Description

Wrapper is a program whose only function is to run other programs. It is
intended to use in HTML based menu systems to enable the execution of 
programs on the computer where the HTML file is displayed.

All Internet browsers have very strong protection against this very action,
as usually it is not intended that the author of a HTML site can run local
programs. This protection though prevents the use of HTML pages as menu
system, which brings many advantages expecially in order to build complex
menus that include extensive explanations. In adition a HTML based menu
system is very independant from the client computers and with the help of
wrapper a truly flexible menu system (that can work on any computer) can be
designed.

Wrapper has two modes of operation:
1. Direct execution of supplied file
2. Execution of actions defined in a data file

In the 1st mode wrapper expects exactly one argument, the name of an
executable file (meaning something that can be passed to WinExec from
the Win32 API, e.g. EXE,COM,BAT,PIF ...). The extension of the file is
in most cases NOT important. In this mode wrapper simply runs the 
program and exits.

In the 2nd mode wrapper also expects exactly one argument, the name of
a wrapper data file. The action to be taken has to be specified in the
data file. Optionally wrapper can download a file from the Internet prior
to doing the action. Wrapper also performs variable and registry key
substitution in the data file to enable flexible commands.

After running the action the data file (= the file supplied on the command line)
is deleted, if possible.

wrapper can handle a list of application shortcuts and a list of restrictions
(a list of command lines which are allowed to run). The application
shortcuts come to solve the problem that on different computers there might
be different programs installed to hande certain file types. Thus on one
computer there could be a shortcut bmpedit=c:\windows\pbrush.exe while on
an other computer the shortcut could be bmpedit=c:\somedir\someprog.exe
(assuming that someprog.exe is a bitmap editor). Giving as action in the
wrapper data file Application=bmpedit [some_bmp_file], on both computers
this action would work, though different programs would be started.

See the Wrapper section for details on restrictions.

2.	Wrapper

Installation:
For Windows 9x right-click the WRAPPER.INF file and choose Install.
This will install wrapper into the Windows directory and associate .WRP
files with wrapper.
For all other Windows versions or when the above doesn't work, copy
WRAPPER.EXE to any directory in your path and associate it with .WRP
files.
Make sure that .WRP files are automatically downloaded (make sure the option
"Confirm after download" is NOT checked in the file association details). If you
use Netscape you might have to do special configuration in Netscape to achieve
the same.

Usage:
WRAPPER.EXE <file>

file is the name of a filename which can either be an executable or a wrapper
data file. wrapper data files must begin with the line [Wrapper] and may not
contain anything else in the first line (see examples below). The data file
is in the format of Windows INI files, meaning it consists of Key=Value lines
with the following keys recognized:

Download=HTTP://address,local-file
	downloads the specified file to the local-file

Application=app-name [params...]
	runs the specified app-name if found in application list. If not
	wrapper will show an error message

Shell=command,file
	passes command and file to the ShellExecute function in the Win32 API
	This tries to run the shell command on the file (See examples)

Run=command line
	Passes the command line to the WinExec function in the Win32 API
	If restrictions are enabled, the COMPLETE command line has to appear
	in the list of restrictions to be allowed to be run.

The data file signature ([Wrapper]) has to be exactly like this as it is looked
for exactly. All other keywords and parameters are not case sensitive.

To download the file from the Internet wrapper can make use of a proxy server.
The exact behaviour is determined by the proxy registry setting (see below for
the key). If it is empty or non-existing, wrapper will try to use the Windows
Internet Settings definition for http proxy. If the proxy key is set to the word
"noproxy", then no proxy will be used. Otherwise a proxy-server can be specified
in the proxy key (e.g. "proxy.network.com:8080").

During the download a progress bar is displayed to the user to give some status
information for long downloads.

3.	WrapperConf

WrapperConf is the configuration utility for wrapper. It provides a convinient
way to edit the lists of application shortcuts and of restrictions without need
for the user to know (mostly) anything about the workings of wrapper or of the
registry.

WrapperConf has a main working window with two tabs for applications and
restrictions respectively. On the bottom there is an input mask with the
possibility to browse for the programs to enter.

The Data menu provides advanced saving and loading options to handle multiple
sets of data or deal with settings from other computers.

The Tools menu has some commonly used functions, as well as an option to set the
proxy server for wrapper.

To add an application shortcut:
Go to the Applications tab, enter the name of the shortcut into the Name field,
enter the program for the shortcut into the Value field (you can use Browse to
look for a program in reach of your computer). Press "Add to List".

To delete an application shortcut:
Double-Click a shortcut in the list, it will be selected and also copied to the
input mask at the bottom. Press "Delete from List" to delete.

To load the content of the registry (= the active configuration for this
computer), press "Load from Registry". This is done automatically when you start
the program

To save the (changed) content of the list, press "Save to Registry". This will
save the current list to the computer for wrapper to use as configuration.

To clear the list, choose Data->Clear. This only clears the list in the editor,
not in the registry. Use "Save to Registry" to save an empty list to the
registry.

To add items from an external file into the list use Data->"Load From". This
looks for a .reg style file with the right heading (meaning you couldn't load
restrictions into the applications list like this, and vice versa). You can
supply a file with many registry settings, "Load From" will load only the
relevant section. For example you can load a dataset saved on another computer
like this.

Use Data>"Save As" to save the current list as a ready-to-import .reg file. This
file can be merged on another computer into the registry to set wrapper to what
you see now in the editor.



Hints:
------
All WrapperConf's functionality is also included in regedit.exe, though not
so convienient. In all cases where WrapperConf doesn't work or it is not clear
to the user what is happening I advice to use regedit (or regedt32) to do all
registry changes manually.

To copy one value between the two lists double-click it in one list and then
change to the other list and press "Add to List"

4. 	Hints,Tips,Background

Registry Keys:
All settings are saved under the following key:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\GeniSoft\wrapper

The key contains at least a version stamp (which is not used in the program) and
optionally the proxy value for the proxy configuration and optionally two sub-
keys called applications and restrict. The applications key contains a list of
string values that define the application shortcuts (the name of the value is the
name of the shortcut, while the value is it's content). The restrict key contains
a list of allowed command lines for the Run= command. The name of these values is
unimportant and can be set to a convinient description of the command line.
Sample registry tree:

REGEDIT4

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\GeniSoft]

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\GeniSoft\wrapper]
@="Version 1.0 20/07/1999"
"proxy"="noproxy"

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\GeniSoft\wrapper\restrictions]
"setdate"="command.com /cdate"

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\GeniSoft\wrapper\applications]
"bmpedit"="c:\\windows\\pbrush.exe"
"browser"="c:\\program files\\internet explorer\\iexplore.exe"


If different proxy servers are set for different protocols, then there MUST be 
a setting for HTTP since wrapper looks for http= in the Internet Setings. If
there is no setting for HTTP then the program will not be able to download
files from the Internet.

The restricted program list is ONLY applied to the Run= parameter. Both
Application= and Shell= parameters are NOT checked against the restricted
applications list (since Windows is able to run them anyway, and also the
user when he as access to the context menu).

If the restrict key exists but has no string values in it, only pre-defined
applications can be run. Also no files are downloaded. If they key exists and
has values in it, only the programs listed in the values (NOT the value names)
are allowed to be run by the Run= parameter. Downloads are enabled and Shell=
and Application= are also enabled.

The names of the string values in the applications list MUST be without spaces 
and special chars in order for correct shortcut substitution to work.

The wrapper file is parsed in the following order:
1. Download=
2. Application=
3. Shell=
4. Run=
If wrapper finds something to do, it won't look for the other ones. This means
that if you have an Application= parameter AND also a Run= parameter, the
Run= parameter will be ignored in any case, even if the Application= parameter
doesn't work or resolve to something etc.

The wrapper data file MUST begin with [Wrapper] in the first line. This test
is CASE-SENSITIVE !!!. All files which do not have this signature are passed to
WinExec if no restrictions are set.

The registry substitution happens before the environment substitution because some
registry values tend to contain environment variables. In order to read the default
value of a key, simply ommit the value like in "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.txt\".

6.	Example Data Files

____________________________________
[Wrapper]
Application=notepad
------------------------------------
This simply starts notepad, assuming that the application shortcut notepad is
defined and pointing to notepad

____________________________________
[Wrapper]
Download=http://your.server.net/some/form.txt,%TEMP%\form.txt
Shell=open,%TEMP%\form.txt
------------------------------------
This would download the specified form.txt from a web server and open it for
editing on the local machine. Very good to provide forms to be filled out,
printed and handed in by the user.

____________________________________
[Wrapper]
run=fyi.exe " " "Your current Windows Proxy Settings:" "?HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\ProxyServer?" "Your COMSPEC is %COMSPEC%" "Your DOS path is:" "%PATH%"
------------------------------------
This shows the proxy settings and some env variables. fyi.exe is another program
I wrote to display information given on the command line. This of course only
works if no restrictions are set. Note that all the command is ONE line given to
Run=.
