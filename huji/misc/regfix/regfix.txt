Fix registry

This little batch checks wether the registry is valid (e.g. not broken). It
does so by trying to read HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*. If this fails (for whatever
reason), the registry is replaced by it's backup (system.da0 and user.da0).

If this happens again on the very next boot (meaning that the registry is STILL
broken), then regfix.bat installs a "safe" registry (from %WINDIR%\regbkup) that
should have been created by some other means (e.g. PatchWS). It also copies the
WIN.INI and SYSTEM.INI files since they reflect part of the registry.

The script uses regedit2.exe, which should be regedit.exe from a Win98 
installation. I do so because it is much better than the original Win95 
regedit.exe since the latter one has much more problems reading the registry
under DOS when regedit2 and win95 itself read it just fine. 

This prevents the "Registry is damaged, do you want to restore it from the
backup" screen from appearing since it does the same task (and more)
