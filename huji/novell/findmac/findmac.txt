FindMAC v1.0

Extracts the node address from ODI driver output
Usage: ODIDRIVER.COM | FindMAC
or     ODIDRIVER.COM | FindMAC <MAC Token>
       where MAC Token is the word you expect to be before
       the MAC address (like node, MAC, Address ...)
In the first form, the token is assumed to be Address

FindMAC returns the found MAC address in the standard output
without newline. The MAC address is padded with 0 at the
beginning till a length of 12 digits to be used in Novell's
standard way of writing.
