<title>Schlomo Schapiro - White Paper - Public PC Installation</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<h1 align="center">Public PC Installation</h1>

<h2 align="left">Situation:</h2>

<p>We had a student information system based on VT-520's and a
text mode browser running on Unix. Now we want to replace this
with a more modern system since the web-based student information
systems require a graphical browser. The browser has to be as
maintenance-free as the terminals and be as much remote-managable
as the terminals.</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>Since we have to use MS Internet Explorer (because of Hebrew),
we decided to build the public PC on Windows NT. We secured the
computer and installed a restricted web-browser (ResBrowser) that
limits the user to browse only on the intranet. The computer
boots directly into this browser and does not offer the usual
Windows user interface, but runs the browser as full-screen kiosk
application. Remote management is done using the standard Windows
NT remote management tools (remote regedit, remote command,
windows network). To ensure maximum protection we completely lock
the computer via remote regedit. We also employ VNC for visual
remote control.</p>

<h2>Installation:</h2>

<p>In order to achieve a maximum protected environment on NT we
followed the following installation path:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Windows NT General Setup</li>
    <li>Public User Setup</li>
    <li>Task Manager</li>
    <li>Ctrl-Alt-Del</li>
    <li>Boot</li>
    <li>Auto Logout</li>
    <li>Windows NT Explorer</li>
    <li>Internet Explorer (ResBrowser is an IE wrapper)</li>
    <li>Scheduled Items &amp; Services</li>
    <li>Registry</li>
</ol>

<h4>1. Windows NT General Setup</h4>

<p>The NT 4 setup is rather simple. After installing NT on NTFS,
the latest service pack, IE 5 and the latest Resource Kit we use
C2Setup from the Resource Kit to close many security holes (like
boot and file system). Nevertheless we found out that IE 5
doesn't run well when it has only read rights on the system
directories, so we gave the public user the usual Change rights (that
come with the NT installation). Network setup is TCP/IP only with
the Windows Network. We disable the Computer Browser service to
prevent the public computer from participating in existing
Windows networks, it is sufficient to know the computers IP
address to access it from the network. I also had to increase the
Registry Size after installing IE 5.</p>

<h4>2. Public User Setup</h4>

<p>Since we did not want the public browser to be logged on as
Administrator we changed the Guest account into the public
account (by renaming it and changeing it's settings). The public
user does not belong to any group (Except everyone which is built-in),
has no password (important for the auto-login), no right to
change the password and no timeouts (for password etc.). After
creating the user in this manner we log on as public and set up
the Internet Explorer and the screen saver (see above, logs out
automatically). All further user setup can be done via regedt32
from another computer.</p>

<h4>3. Task Manager</h4>

<p>Since we use ResBrowser as shell we have to leave some
backdoor open for the administrator. This backdoor is the Task
Manager (<strong>%SYSTEM32%\TASKMGR.EXE</strong>). We change the
file security permissions for TASKMGR.EXE so that the user
administrator has Full Access to it, while the user public has No
Access to it. Thus when the computer is running in normal kiosk
user mode (logged in as public) the user has no access to run the
Task Manager and Ctrl-Shift-ESC as well as choosing &quot;Task
Manager&quot; from the &quot;Windows NT Security&quot; screen
have no effect. When the administrator logs onto the computer,
the Task Manager is available and through it the administrator
can run all relevant programs (like EXPLORER.EXE or MUSRMGR.EXE).</p>

<h4>4. Ctrl-Alt-Del</h4>

<p>I did not find a convienient way to completely disable Ctrl-Alt-Del.
Nevertheless I think it's even beneficiary to leave it since
through it a benevolent user can restart a stuck computer (don't
forget, we talk Windows), while the possibilities to damage are
more or less nil. The Change Password dialog pops up but I
disabled the right to change the password so that this is mostly
cosmetics. Logging Off logs of and then the computer
automatically logs on agains and returns to the opening screen of
the public browser. Locking the Workstation is less pleasant, but
everybody can unlock it by pressing the OK button since the
public user has no password. The Task Manager can not be run (see
above) and the last option, Shutdown, is even welcome since
somebody can restart the computer if neccessary</p>

<h4>5. Boot</h4>

<p>The boot is safe as far as NT and the BIOS are concerned. Of
course we put a BIOS password and disabled boot from floppy. On
the NT side we disabled the boot menu by setting the timeout to 0.
Otherwise NT is already quite safe in terms of booting. From the
Last Known Good menu users cannot do any harm.</p>

<h4>6. Auto Logout</h4>

<p>One of the interesting parts of the NT Resource Kit is it's <strong>WINEXIT.SCR</strong>
screen saver. After a certain period of inactivity the current
user is logged out automaticall, after which the computer logs on
automatically as the public user. Like this the computer returns
to a fixed initial state after nobody has been using it for some
time. This also solves the cases where a malicious user locked
the Workstation and nobody thinks about the empty password (though
usually people click on OK before actually reading the contents
:-) or when IE got stuck or the browser crashed etc.</p>

<h4>7. Windows NT Explorer</h4>

<p>We created a user (public) so that on the computer exist two
user (administrator and public). In normal operation mode the
computer logs on automatically as public. To disable the explorer
we change the Windows <strong>shell</strong> from explorer.exe to
ResBrowser (see later under Registry). This completely disables
the explorer and most of the Windows user interface, as well as
shortcut keys like WinKey-M for &quot;Minimize all Windows&quot;.</p>

<h4>8. Internet Explorer</h4>

<p>We have to use Internet Explorer due to it's superior multi-language
capabilities. We used a limited browser based on IE (<a
href="../misc/index.html#resbrow">ResBrow</a>) that gives a very
basic user interface and allows us to limit the sites accessible.
With a registry patch we disabled the context menu (after
enableing the language encoding Auto-Select feature) so that the
user can only click on links to follow them. Since ResBrow is
based on IE it makes use of IE's security settings. We set these
settings in a very limiting and restricting way, disableing
mostly everything (Especially downloads and password memory and
cacheing and history) in the Internet and Intranet security zone.
In these settings are many security risks, especially if you
cannot disable active content (scripting). If you need cookies,
you have to leave them enabled.</p>

<h4>9. Scheduled Items &amp; Services</h4>

<p>We use several services and scheduled items that do not come
with a vanilla installation of NT:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Floppy Locker (Resource Kit):<br>
        Simply install the Floppy Locker as described in the
        Resource Kit</li>
    <li>Scheduler (Resource Kit):<br>
        Install the schedule service and use WinAT (even from a
        remote computer) to set up the following services:<ol>
            <li>every night: shutdown /l /r /t:0 /y /c<br>
                shutdown is part of the Resource Kit. We do this
                to have a full boot once a day.</li>
            <li>every day: <a href="PublicCleanUp.bat.txt">PublicCleanUp.bat</a><br>
                This batch cleans the disk from trash IE produces.
                To keep the disk from filling up.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Remote Console (Resource Kit)</li>
    <li>Time Service (Resource Kit)<br>
        Set it up to your favorite time provider (e.g. NTP)
        according the the instructions in the Resource Kit.</li>
    <li>VNC Server (<a href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/">Virtual
        Network Computing</a>)<br>
        Be sure to set up the default settings (password etc.). I
        advice to disable the keyboard and mouse while the
        computer is beeing remote managed.</li>
</ul>

<h4>10. Registry</h4>

<p>The following patch under HKEY_USERS\ disables the IE settings
that cannot be disabled by the Internet Settigns Control Panel:</p>

<p>This patch under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE sets the Auto Logon and
the shell:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The main problem I noticed with the auto login feature is that
the system sets the user name to the last logged in user and
disables the auto-login. I solved that problem by setting the
permissions to the WinLogon subkey to Read Only for everybody (including
Administrator !). I use this mechanism to lock the public PC via
remote regedit so that nobody can log on as anything else except
public, which is already severely limited.</p>
