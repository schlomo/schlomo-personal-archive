<p align="left">We had a student information system based on VT-520's
and a text mode browser running on Unix. Now we want to replace
this with a more modern system since the web-based student
information systems require a graphical browser. The browser has
to be as maintenance-free as the terminals and be as much remote-managable
as the terminals</p>
