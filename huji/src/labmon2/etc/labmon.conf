# labmon Configuration Options:
# Note: Don't put "" around multi-word arguments. The first argument has to be
#	without spaces or tabs and everything following till the next newline is
#	taken as the 2nd argument !
# Note: All directory options have to be given with a trailing / !!!
#
# debug	<1|0>	
#	1 = enable debug, 0 = disable debug
#	Debugging info is extensive and written to STDOUT
# net <name> <IP-range>
#	Define a new network range to be monitored. IP-range is a class C
# 	network of the form 192.168.10.10-200.
# pattern <name> <perl regex>
#	Define a new pattern. Example: pattern dummy User:\s(a\w+)
#	This example will match a line with "User: admin" in it.
#	The pattern should contain ONE pair of () to extract textual information
#	that is relevant (see info)
# counter <name>
#	Count how many computers' fingerd has the <name> pattern in it
#	Following above example, count how many usernames start with "a"
#	All counts are per network, a total summary is printed for all networks
# info <name>
#	Extract text info from named pattern and show it for each computer.
#	Use this to show the username and other data for each computer.
# color <name> <RGB>
#	Set the named color in HTML-style RGB. Example: color numback FBFBFB
#	The following colors are defined:
#	numback	Color of background of numerical picture
#	numfree Color of foreground for free computers in numerical picture
#	numtotal Color of total amount of computers in numerical picture
#	text	Color of text in net map picture
#	offline	Color of offline mark in net map picture
#	busy	Color of busy mark in net map picture
#	free	Color of available mark in net mark picture
# picpatch <name> <PNG-file>
#	Define a source picture for network map picture patching for named net
#	Example: picpatch mynet mypic.png
#	labmom will patch mypic.png according to the information of the mynet 
#	network. It will copy it from the given filename (relative to the
#	config file) to the directory specified by $gfxoutdir.
# map <name> <map file>
#	Define network map picture map for named network. This file contains the
#	IP->(x,y) coordinates translation for the network map picture. labmon
#	will flood-fill the area around the given coordinate for the computer
#	that matches the IP address, so you should make sure that the given 
#	point has a closed border since otherwise the flood-fill will fill all 
#	the picture. The format for the map file is IP X Y with one set per line
#	Example: 192.168.10.10	102 103
# numpic <name> <PNG-file>
#	Create a numerical picture for the named network in the named file.
#	The file will be created in the dir given by $numgfxoutdir. The picture
#	contains 2 numbers, the free computers and the total amount of 
#	computers. As available it takes all free and offline computers.
# numcomps <name> <number>
#	Set the amount of computers in the given network. This is neccessary if
#	the network contains more IP addresses than real computers (like if you 
#	use DHCP and assigned more IPs than neccessary). This will adjust the 
#	total numbers of computers for telling how many computers are offline
#	Example: In a class of 10 computer you assing 20 IPs. Without numcomps
#	set to 10 you will always have at least 10 free computers since labmon
#	can't know wether the computers don't exist or are switched off. Setting
#	numcomps to 10 will tell labmon to assume that the total amount of 
#	computers is 10 and all calculations that take off the free & busy 
#	computers from the total amount will use this number as the total amount
#	and not the total amount of IPs in the fiven network.
# option <name> <value>
#	Set a named option to a value. The following options exist:
#	backlog		If set to yes, create a backlog of all info. The log
#			will be created in the $logdir directory (defaults to
#			$outdir."log/") under a directory tree by date 
#			(year/month/day). The log can be used to calculate
#			very exact accounting info and make usage graphs.
#	delay		Amount of seconds that has to pass at least between
#			two following checks of the same network. labmon 
#			measures the time it takes to pass all networks (which
#			depends on the amount of busy and free computers)
#			and waits the neccessary time if it passes all the
#			networks "too fast". Use this to prevent unneccessary
#			network traffic, e.g. if you need data with a precision
#			of 10 minutes, set the delay to 600.
#	refreshtime	Initital refreshtime for HTML pages. defaults to the
#			delay time.
#	outdir		The directory where to put the detailed HTML files
#	gfxoutdir	where to put network map pics
#	numgfxoutdir	where to put numerical pics (they are not used by the
#			HTML produced by labmon)
#	urlgfx		Where to find the pics in $gfxoutdir from the webbrowser
#			labmon can't know where you put them on your webserver.
#	putipinpix	Set to yes if you want labmon to write the IP under the
#			coordinated in the network class picture.
#	lastmodpic	Set to yes to have labmon create a picture file 
#			(lastmod.png) in the $numgfxoutdir with the current
#			date & time. This is useful to show the user when the
#			numerical pics where last updated.
