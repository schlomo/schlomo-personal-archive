<h1 align="center">White Paper - Computer Classes Installation</h1>

<h2>Situation:</h2>

<p>We have several student computer labs on the campus. The aim
is to create a similar working environment for the students in
all these labs, while keeping each lab unique in the software
packages it offers. At the same time we want to manage all our
PCs centrally from the network and control as much as possible
from the network. In all classes exist groups of identical PCs (in
terms of hardware) and each class is connected to a local file
server. Currently all classes have their own, separate
installation with local users, but do not make use of ZEN. The
computers have to be protected against harm from students and
against abuse and software installation. </p>

<h2>Final Solution:</h2>

<p>All classes present an identical working environment to the
student (who have an account on a central student file server).
In each class the existing local users continue to work with
their previous accounts and environment they got used to. At the
same time the students can log on in all the classes and use
their own home dir and applications. All classes have a certain
amount of &quot;standard applications&quot; (like Office and
tools), while each class supplies in addition programs local to
it (mostly specialized applications like MatLAB, Geology programs
etc). </p>

<p>The computers in the classes have an automatic installation
system that allows the local admin to easily re-install a broken
computer. Also many routine tasks are done automatically and
centralized (like NAV update). Printer settings, applications and
many aspects of the Workstation setup can be changed from the
network. Also the computers protection can be set from the
network, administrators have only light protection while students enjoy
more severe limitations of their activities. </p>

<p>Application icons are managed in the network and user see
different icons depending where they log on. </p>

<p>All computers have a unique ID and are registered on the
network to allow direct manipulation of a specific computer via
the network. This includes Remote Control to help students from a
helpdesk team. </p>

<h2>Detailed Solution:</h2>

<h3>1. Programs &amp; Tools used:</h3>

<dir>
    <LI>Novell ZENWorks </LI>
    <LI>Fortres 4 </li>
    <li>Symantec Ghost </li>
    <li>UpdateWS &amp; AutoGhost2 (a set of applications to
        automatically install computers from the network,
        developed in-house) <h3>2. Computer setup:</h3>
        <p>We work with ghost images to install the computers.
        Therefore we first create a standard image for each group
        of identical PC hardware. This installation contains
        Windows 98, MS Office, IE5, NS4.08 and many tools (GS,
        WinZIP, Acrobat, TclTK, NAV etc.). These images are
        installed in each class and then customized to the local
        classes demands (usually installation of further software
        packages). </p>
        <p>The next step is to connect the computers to the
        network, both physically and logically. For each computer
        we create a ZENWorks workstation object. The naming
        convention we use is &quot;Computer Name&quot;+&quot;MAC-Address&quot;,
        where the Computer-Name is related to the name of the
        class the computer is in. Like this we have a naming
        scheme which on one hand gives most information (what
        computer in what class) while at the same time containing
        only information which the computer itself has (This is
        important for automatic registration of the computer
        after installation). The computers WS objects are created
        in a new sub-container for each class to have easy access
        to a computer in a specific class and to allow for easy
        grouping of computers. In most cases we create the new
        containers under the existing containers for each class (that
        contain users etc. from the previous setup). To make
        computer installation easier we create the appropriate WS
        objects before installing the computers so that when the
        computers install and boot, they can connect to an
        existing WS object (See later for the exact details). </p>
        <p>Next we create Workstation groups for each class and
        Workstation Policy packages. In the Policy package we
        define the following parameters: </p>
    </li>
    <li>Printing </li>
    <li>Login Restrictions </li>
    <li>Start the NAL program on user login </li>
    <li>(In some classes shutdown at class closing time) <p>We
        also create an application (Called WS-Init) that is force
        run by the workstation at the login screen. This
        application runs all necessary programs that we want to
        have run at boot as well as sets the computers USER
        policy to very strict restrictions (We do this instead of
        using a User Policy Package for our students). This setup
        allows us to have both the computer aspects and the user
        aspects of Policy settings connected to the workstation,
        what is what we want (since we want to protect the
        workstation, not prevent the user from using Windows on a
        non-class computer). </p>
        <p>The computer's limitations are set as follows: </p>
    </li>
    <li>no write access on C: (Except by some specifically
        allowed alps) (by Fortres) </li>
    <li>disable most of Windows' user interface (Control Panel
        &amp; CPLs, IE features, Desktop things, Drive C: in
        explorer etc. (WS-Init by Policies). <p>We also create a
        User Policy Package for admins that undoes most of WS-Init's
        limitations so that admins get a fairly &quot;open&quot;
        PC (except of course Fortres limitations). </p>
        <p>Now we create application objects for all the programs
        installed. We associate these applications with the
        workstation group of each class (we create identical app
        objects in each class container, though in principle it
        is possible to use a centralized application container and
        keep there all the applications which are common to all
        classes. This, however, puts high demands on the network
        infrastructure and increases NDS traffic noticeably).
        Some applications we associate with the user (both
        students and previous user in each class via their
        respective containers) so that they will have them
        everywhere. The user-associated apps are programs that
        depend on the user and not the computer, like &quot;Home
        Directory&quot;, &quot;Logout&quot;, &quot;Change
        Password&quot; (for the legacy users. Students use an
        external system for password changes), and &quot;Account
        Information&quot; to display some info and statistics. All
        applications that we create do their own setup (if
        necessary), like mapping of search drives, creation of
        temporary files etc.. </p>
        <p>The login script of each container involved (both the
        student container and the class containers) is stripped
        to a bare minimum of </p>
    </li>
    <li>setting ENV variables about almost everything </li>
    <li>map search drives to sys:public and a dir with our utils </li>
    <li>if exists, map drive to user's home directory <p>Summation
        of Computer setup and some advantages: </p>
    </li>
    <li>All computer related settings are connected to the
        computer and not to users (via workstation objects), this
        includes running NAL and other programs and protecting
        the computer. </li>
    <li>All application specific settings are in the respective
        application object </li>
    <li>Full control of computers in the network, from assigning
        apps or scheduled items to remote control. </li>
    <li>Flexible computer protection: Strong for users and weak
        for admins. <h3>3. Automatic installation</h3>
        <p>The automatic installation procedure consists of
        several parts: </p>
    </li>
    <li>A version control system that assigns each computer and
        installation a unique computer group and version. Each
        computer checks its version against the &quot;should be&quot;
        version kept on the network and installs itself if
        necessary </li>
    <li>A unique and &quot;native&quot; naming scheme for the
        computers' workstation objects in NDS (Name+MAC Address).
        After installation the computer patches itself on first
        boot to point to the correct workstation object (easy
        because we use MAC address and not some arbitrary or
        changing data to build the name). </li>
    <li>Simple to use bootdisks for image creation and
        workstation installation to help local admins re-install
        broken PCs and admins create new images. <p>All of the
        above is implemented either using DOS batch scripts or,
        if necessary, small Pascal programs with source code
        included. </p>
        <h4>Detailed Description:</h4>
        <p>We give each group of identical PCs a group name, e.g.
        A. In this group we keep a version number, e.g. 4. This
        information is stored locally on each PC in the CONFIG.SYS
        file (in two ENV vars, WSGROUP &amp; VERSION). On the
        network it sits in SYS:LOGIN\WSGROUP\%WSGROUP%\updatews.dat
        of the local classroom file servers. A small program (UpdateWS)
        run on boot before login (from either RunServices in the
        registry, a force-run application or the Workstation
        Policy Package) compares the two versions and if they do
        not agree replaces config.sys and autoexec.bat on the
        computer with a set that boots to the network in DOS and
        restarts the computer. The computer then boots into the
        network and uses the AutoGhost2 system to install the
        correct image for this workstation (see below). </p>
        <p>The AutoGhost2 system is a set of DOS batches that </p>
    </li>
    <li>recognizes the correct workstation group by IPX network
        number and other means of identifying the computer (strings
        in BIOS, nic drivers loaded etc) </li>
    <li>maps drives to the correct locations of the updatews.dat
        version file on the network and the location of the
        actual ghost images </li>
    <li>dumps the correct ghost image and reboots the computer or
        shuts it down (depending on the computers hardware) <p>The
        advantage of the AutoGhost2 system is that all the
        intelligence to decide what to install is on the network
        thus enabling us to use generic bootdisks for all
        computers that do not ask any questions as to what to
        install etc (unattended install). Also it allows us to
        boot into the network in several unattended ways and make
        use of the SAME system there: </p>
    </li>
    <li>UpdateWS initiated updating/installation </li>
    <li>Remote boot PROMS with Wake On LAN </li>
    <li>local admin uses bootdisk to install computer. <p>A run-once
        style set of DOS batches is run on a workstation on the
        first boot after ghost image dump (calls PatchWS). This
        loads the nic drivers, extracts from the output the MAC
        address, unloads the nic drivers and patches the ZENWorks
        workstation association object in the registry according
        to the correct workstation name. Thus already on the
        first boot the Workstation is completely set up and ready
        to be used. </p>
        <p>Especially together with Wake On Lan it is very easy
        to automatically reinstall complete computer classes at
        night, since the whole process is automatic and
        asynchronous, meaning that one computer is completely
        independent from the other computers (as opposed to
        multicast installations where the operators have to make
        sure that all computers are ready before beginning the
        image dump). With modern network infrastructures and
        compression also large classes can easily be installed
        during one or two hours, even without multicast or
        similar techniques. </p>
        <h3>4. Network based management &amp; Conclusions</h3>
        <p>After thus installing the computer labs and creating a
        good basis for re-installing the system with the least
        effort we try to manage and install the computers only
        from the network. This includes: </p>
    </li>
    <li>Applying regular updates &amp; changes through NAL
        application installations </li>
    <li>Running oftenly changing things from the network </li>
    <li>Easily changing computer setup and level of Windows
        protection from the network, as well as other settings
        like printer setup etc. </li>
    <li>Installing temporary applications through NAL in %TEMP%
        or run them from the network. </li>
    <li>Using applications exclusively for almost everything that
        we want to do to the computers. </li>
    <li>Associating applications with sub-groups of workstations
        to give some temporary application to some course in only part of
        the class. </li>
    <li>Shutting down computers, sending messages to users etc.
        via application objects or scheduled items that execute
        within the next 5 minutes (or whatever we set as refresh
        time). </li>
    <li>Enabling the helpdesk to view a user's desktop to help
        solve problems where they occur. <p>Since we use Fortres
        to protect our computers and not some hardware based
        solution that undoes all changes on reboot we can use all
        of the above features since they rely on saving
        information to the disk permanently (like NAL GUID stamps
        of application versions, post-image-installation etc.).
        For computers where Fortres is too limiting it is
        possible to simply re-install the computers each night
        and use only light or none Windows policy restrictions. </p>
        <p>An added advantage of using application objects and of
        moving most of the setup to the network is easy backup
        through our central backup system and documentation
        through the details in the application itself. </p>
        <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
        <p>With the above strategy of computer installation we on
        one hand achieve a very well installed and manageable
        system using mostly standard tools (where they exist)
        while keeping all possibilities for future changes and
        improvements even from the network while on the other
        hand we distribute the load over the network (by using
        sub-containers) and including previous installations and
        user setups in each location. The high amount of items
        that are manageable through the network helps us admins to
        administrate our network more efficient since many
        problems we can now solve from remote and through the
        network. </p>
