<h1 align="center">How To create users with a limited set of
applications&nbsp; </h1>
This is an email I wrote on that subject. I tried twice to write a nice howto, but both times the
editor crashed on me so it will stay like this:

Subject: limited user

Hi Friends, 

after I AGAIN wrote that HowTo and AGAIN the program crashed on me just
as I was to press the Save button ( this time FP Express, not NS) and of
course AGAIN my long text was GONE I am giving up. This how to will
probably never be written by me, therefore I am sending you the essentials
by email (if now also pine will crash on me I wil lprobably start to use
mailx or simply telnet to localhost:25):

1. The trick is to close NAL after using it to setup an alternative
environment for the user. For this I created an application called
Remove_NAL_Force that closes NAL.

2. To set up a limted user create the user and a special application for
this user. This application should do the following steps:
- run some default application
- create icons on the Windows desktop that point to other applications
that user should be able to run (probably including the default
application in case the user closes it)
- do whatever else should be done to initialize the users working
environment (such as place default files in defaul places, display some
initial announcements etc,).
After setting up this application make sure that it's icon ordering is
less than 9999 (that of Remove_NAL_Force) and associate the special
applictaion object and Remove_NAL_Force to the limited user as Force Run.

That's it !

PS: A more sophisticated and much better solution is the run NALDESK.EXE
from NAL, close NAL and associate the required applications to the user
and mark them to be shown on the Desktop. This is especially recommended
if the user is to use existing applications and should simply be
restricted from seeing all the standard applications associated with the
workstation.

For example I think I should move the Regist user to the NALDESK trick
since now I am creating icons that use NALRUN32 to run the original
application object (which is like scratching your nose from behind the
head).

PPS: I am setting up http://shum.cc.huji.ac.il/~schapiro/howto as HowTo
dir for internal HUJI use only. That is why I won't put a link to it on my
"official" home page, sine there I write for people who know our tree and
how we set up things here.

PPS: Windows is simply and unstable operating system, I am convinced it
simply from time to time crashes the active application to remind you that
the other apps are getting bored and would also like to have some of your
attention. (Or why is it that ALWAYS the app that I am working with  is
crashing ?)
