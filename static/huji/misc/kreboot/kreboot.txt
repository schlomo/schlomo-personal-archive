KReboot v1.0

This program is a 32 bit program to do a Ctrl-Alt-Del. It initiates a warm boot using
the keyboard controller, just like pressing C-A-D. Be aware of the fact that this 
program does not neccessarily write unwritten caches to the disk nor does it do any 
other "clean-up". USE AT YOUR OWN RISK !!!

TimerKreboot v1.0

This is KReboot with a timer. Give a number (seconds) as option and TimerKReboot
reboots the machine (just as KReboot) after said amount of seconds. Any further
options are displayed in a message box PRIOR to starting the timer. This means
that if a user won't close the message box, the timer won't start and the
machine won't reboot !! (This is to be improved in further versions)
