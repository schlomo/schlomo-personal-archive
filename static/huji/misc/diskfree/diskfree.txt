DiskFree v 1.0
6.10.1999 Schlomo Schapiro

This little tool let's you run a program when the free space on a
drive is lower than a settable limit (Or when there is
"too much" free space). Usage is simple, look at the examples. The only
trick is how to pass quotes into DiskFree.

Examples:
DiskFree H:\ 500000 fyi '"scc'" '"Your Home Directory (H:\) has less"' "'than 500 KByte free space.'" '"You should delete some files in H: to "' "'clear up more space. '" '" '" '"Press Continue for more information"'

(sorry for the long line, but it's a one command line !!)
Note the '"scc'" It's a single quote followed by a double quote. Only like 
this you can pass params INTO DiskFree that also contains spaces.

DiskFree C:\ -50 'some prog'

This will start some prog if you have MORE THAN 50 bytes free on C:\ :-)
