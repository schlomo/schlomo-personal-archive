ResBrow v 1.21

1999,2000 - G. S. Schapiro

Abstract:

ResBrow is a IE4 (or higher) encapsulation in a very simple and restrictive
user interface. The purpose is to give user access to the inter-/intranet without
offering all the options and customization capabilities of the original IE.
Therefore the user interface contains only the following parts:
- Browser window
- Back, Forward, Stop/Refresh, Home, Exit buttons
- One user customizable button (e.g. Mail)
- address bar.
Furthermore ResBrow has a simple URL filter builtin that can be given allowed and
forbidden tokens. Should the user try to browse to any forbidden location, he
will get an error message.

ResBrow also offers a kiosk mode, where it is the only application on the screen
and cannot be closed or minimized. As such it is ideal as explorer replacement
for web-kiosk computers.

ResBrow is configured exclusively through command line options and does not
require installation or any additional files besides the program executable.

Requirements & Limitations

ResBrow relies on an installed Internet Explorer version 4 or higher. All features
(regarding HTML, active content and others) depend on IE and are not under control
of ResBrow. This also means that in order to achieve a well-protected public
browsing computer one has to disable many things in the Internet Options of
Internet Explorer (see below under "Recommended Settings for Maximum Security").

Command Line Syntax:

Mode I: All options given on command line

RESBROW /? will show the following dialog box:

Restricted Browser v 1.21

A highly restrictable IE browser for public access computers
Needs IE 4 or higher installed to function

Usage: ResBrow [Options] [URL]
Options:
  /HOME <URL>                Sets the home address
  /NOURL                     Disables the Address bar
  /MAX                       Opens the program maximized
  /FORCEMAX                  As /MAX but doesn''t allow resizing
  /CLOSEON <Token>           Close Browser if the token is found in URL
  /NOCLOSE                   Prevents the program from beeing closed and
                             disables Ctrl-Alt-Del and Task Manager on Win9x
  /STAYTOP                   Forces the window to stay the topmost
  /BUTTON <Label|Hint> <URL> Adds custom button that links to URL
  /FET <Text>                Changes the Filter Error Text
  /I <Token>                 Shows only URLs containing Token
                             Use several /I to allow access to several sites
  /X <Token>                 Restricts access to URLs containing Token
                             Use several /X to combine limitations

The URL supplied on the command line is taken for the
initial URL. It has to be supplied after all options.
Use /NOURL /FORCEMAX /NOCLOSE /STAYTOP for maximium
Kiosk mode. Disable Ctrl-Alt-Del and the Task Manager (on NT).

/NOHOME sets the URL of the Home button (looks like a house).

/NOURL disables the address bar of the browser (by seting it to readonly). The
current URL will be shown in it, but the user cannot enter URLs. Very good if your
site is closed and doesn't offer links outside.

/MAX opens the window in it's maximized state. The user can minimize it and change
it's size.

/FORCEMAX opens the window maximized and doesn't allow the user to minimize it. In
this mode the window is borderless (Attention: The Windows-M key DOES minimize
the window, you have to disable it otherwise or not load explorer.exe as shell).

/NOCLOSE prevents ResBrow from beeing closed by disableing the Exit button.
ResBrow can be closed from the system menu. ResBrow can still be kicked out
from the Task Manager. Therefore the /NOCLOSE option disables the Ctrl-Alt-Del
and Alt-ESC keys (systemkeys). Unfortunatly this works only on Win9x, on NT you have
to solve this problem otherwise (see Hints below). If this is enabled and the
gets closed (e.g. through the system Menu or the /CLOSEON option), a new ResBrow
window will be opened with the options of the original one.

/STAYTOP sets the ResBrow window to be the topmost window. New windows will open
behind the ResBrow window.

/BUTTON <Label|Hint> <URL> enables the custom button. The button will bear the given
Label and Hint. When clicked RewBrow navigates to the specified URL if it is allowed.

/FET <Text> sets the message displayed to the user whenever ResBrow's URL filter
stops a navigation. It defaults to
"Access to the requested site has been restricted !"

/I <Token> Adds a token to the pattern list of allowed URLs. In order for an URL
to be displayed it has to contain at least one token from the pattern list. Example:
RESBROW /I yahoo.com /I .mil /I .huji.ac.il
This will allow browsing on *yahoo.com* , *.mil* and *.huji.ac.il*. But it will also
allow browsing on sites like www.military-fanatics.com etc.
If you specify any /I, ResBrow automatically adds /I "about: " (see below Hints).

/X <Token> Adds a token to the exclusion pattern list. In order for an URL to be
displayed none of the tokens in the exclusion list may appear in the URL. Example:
RESBROW /X ftp: /X file: /X gopher: /X telnet: /X .zip /X .exe
This will disable most common downloads and disable in general access to the
protocols ftp, file, gopher and telnet since IE can't acess them without this.


Mode II: Read Options from file or URL:

RESBROW /@ <File>

You can circumvent command line length limitations by putting all parameters
into a file and running resbrow as follows:
RESBROW /@ <File>
If you use the /@ option you cannot specify any other option on the command
line. The format of the file is as follows: Each line in the file is a parameters.
Example:
The Parameter Line
/i huji /x ftp: /fet "Not Allowed" /button "Button|Hint Text" URL..
Will translate into the following file:
------------ File ------------
/i
huji
/x
ftp:
/fet
Not Allowed
/button
Button|Hint Text
URL..
---------- End of File -------

Quotations marks are not neccessary in the file as each line is taken as a
parameter. Be careful to put blank spaces at the end of lines only if you intend
the blank space to be part of the parameter (e.g. "huji" is different from "huji "
in the above example).

RESBROW /@ <URL> [/SAVE]

Instead of this you also can read the configuration file from an URL, then
you have to replace the filename with a HTTP URL (e.g. http://server.com/config.dat)
If you do so the first line must contain the word RESBROW only (without spaces
before or after). This is to make sure that the downloaded file is indeed a ResBrow
configuration file.

If the downloaded file is not a ResBrow configuration file ReBrow will be completely
locked (safe mode), print out an rerror message and try again in 1 minute.

The optional /SAVE option will save a copy of the configuration file to the local
harddisk (under %TEMP%). If for any reason ResBrow cannot retrieve the configuration
information from the Internet, it will try to read the (previously saved)
configuration file from %TEMP%. Only if this also fails it will go into safe mode
as above. This is a second-level backup that ensures continued operation of ResBrow
even if temporarily it's configuration server becomes unavailable.

This is especially useful if you want to install many computers with ResBrow and
want to have a central configuration for them.

Recommended Settings for Maximum Security:

1. The following registry values in
[HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Restrictions]
limit Internet Explorer (mostly useful to disable the context menu). All values
have to be DWORDs and should be set to 1 to enable their function:
NoFileOpen             Disables Open command on File menu, CTRL+O, and CTRL+L.

NoFileNew              Disables CTRL+N

NoBrowserSaveAs        Disables Save and Save As on the File menu.

NoBrowserOptions       Disables Internet Options on the View menu.
                       (Disables changing browser settings).

NoFavorites            No Favorites menu, adding to favorites, or
                       organizing favorites.

NoSelectDownloadDir    Prevents user from being able to select download folder
                       by not displaying the Save As dialog box when a file is
                       downloaded.

NoBrowserContextMenu   Disables all context menus.

NoBrowserClose         Disable ALT+F4.

NoFindFiles            Disables the F3 key.

NoTheaterMode          Disables the F11 key.

2. Settings in the Internet Options control panel

2a. Change the security information for the Internet and Local Intranet zones as
restrictive as you want (Disable all download related points and everything that
requires user intervention). This is also the place to disable active content and
scripting.

2b. Disable things on the Advanced page. You should disable everything that might
ask the user questions, disable sounds and movies if you don't want them or don't
have a soundcard installed. Disable all checks (like for newer IE version). Disable
most warnings (for change betwen secure & insecure site etc.). Disable searching
from address bar.

3. To prevent IE from launching external programs you should either prevent access
to them (via file security on NT and NTFS) or remove/change the relevant entrys
on [HKLM\Software\Classes] so that Windows won't know the file types.

Hints:

Before disabling the context menu, make sure that you either set the correct
language encoding or enabled "Auto Select" in the encoding submenu and that
your web-pages carry the apropriate <meta> tag for their encoding.

On Windows NT the /noclose option does not disable the system keys (Ctrl-Alt-Del,
Ctrl-ESC etc.). I found out that the best way to disable the Task Manager is to
prevent the user who runs ResBrow from reading the %SYSTEM32%\TASKMGR.EXE file
by settingappropriate security permissions (needs NTFS).

Use quotation marks (") to protect parameters that contain spaces. Example:
RESBROW /FET "The requested operation is not permitted"

A simple way to display short messages to the user without creating a sperate
HTML file is by using the following URL:
about: This is a sample text
The important part is the space AFTER the about: ! Without it the URL would be
silently discarded.

To disable all non-internet content (like res:\\....\xxx.dll?...) you can add
/X \ to disable all URLs that contain \
