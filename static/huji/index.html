<hr width="70%">
<h3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR=red>Note: I stopped working at HUJI in February 2002 and since then I ceased to develop these tools.
<BR>If you have any questions about them, please email me.

	PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PAGE IS ONLY FOR ARCHIVAL PURPOSES!</FONT></h3>

<p dir="ltr">Here you can find all the software tools and
programs that I have developed for the computation authority at
the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. We use them in
our labs to make life easier for us and the students. Most things
I wrote because I didn't find something similar on the Web or
because what I found wasn't good enough for me or simply not freeware.
Most programs are written for the MS Win32 platform (95++, NT 4++), 
others for Novell Netware and Linux. Most Perl programs should run on
any supported Perl platform, though I use them mostly on Linux.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">Everything you can download from this site is 100 %
freeware. Please download, use and enjoy all programs. I like
privacy myself and that's why I don't ask you to fill out some
silly &quot;registration form&quot; before you can download the
software. Nevertheless I would like to receive some feedback on
the programs and invite you to send me an <a
href="mailto:schlomo+huji@schapiro.org.REMOVE.THIS">email letter</a> about your
usage of my programs, what you like, don't like, suggestions or
simply &quot;Thank You, I was looking for this for ages !&quot;
since this will make me feel better and that I am doing something
useful also for others and surely increase my wish to write more
programs :-) </p>

<p dir="ltr">The programs are divided into 4 groups: </p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="misc">Stand-alone programs</a> that do
something (many of them come to fulfill some function I know from
Linux and miss very much on Windows) and don't need anything
special </p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="novell">Novell Netware (NDS)</a> aware
programs that need NDS for their work and are mostly Network and
End-user related </p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="zen">Novell ZENWorks</a> aware applications.
They need not only NDS but also make only sense when you use Z.E.N.
</p>

<p dir=ltr><a href="linux">Linux</A> related work. Everything from mini
servers to desktop tools using Linux.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">I always try to write programs that are small and
independent and many programs do only some small piece of work
and rely on other programs to do something else (E.g. my DiskFree
program simply runs another program to do whatever instead of
producing a message). This guarantees me the most flexibility in
combining everything as needed and expanding by additional (small
and simple) programs as needed. (To Unix people this attitude
should come natural :-) </p>

<p dir="ltr">Most programs are written in Delphi 3, 4 and 5, some
also in C. The source code is not included, I suggest you to
contact me by email if you are interested in the sources (The
source code is available free of charge). Most Novell aware
programs use Jim Tyson's great NWLib (a set of Netware libraries
for Delphi), more info on <a href="http://www.devont.com/">http://www.devont.com/</a>,
some use the Novell ActiveX controls.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Over the time I also wrote some <a href="papers">technical
and strategical papers</a> on computer lab installation and
network administration. Please feel free to adapt and improve my
ideas.</p>
