# Schlomo Schapiro Personal Archive - Core Architecture

## Project Overview
This is a Hugo static site that serves as a personal archive of PDF presentations and documents. The site automatically generates content from PDF files organized in year-based directories.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Single Source of Truth for Configuration
- **Years are defined ONLY in `hugo.toml`** under `params.years` array
- All templates and scripts read from this centralized configuration
- Never hardcode years in templates or scripts

### 2. Auto-Generated Content Structure
- Content directories (`content/YEAR/`) are created automatically by `generate-data.sh`
- These directories contain minimal `_index.md` files for Hugo section pages
- **IMPORTANT**: Auto-generated content directories are in `.gitignore` - never commit them

### 3. Static File Organization
- PDF files live in `static/YEAR/` directories
- Thumbnails are stored in `static/thumbnails/YEAR/`
- The `generate-data.sh` script scans these directories to create `data/generated.yaml`

## Dependencies
- **Hugo** (static site generator)
- **yq** (YAML processor for reading config)
- **ImageMagick** (thumbnails)
- **Ghostscript** (PDF processing support for ImageMagick)
- **bash 4+** (for readarray and modern features)
