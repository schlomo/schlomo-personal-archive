# Content Processing Rules

## Date Handling Rules
- **NO file modification date fallbacks** (files are copied, dates are meaningless)
- Extract year from filename content using regex `([0-9]{4})`
- Fall back to folder year if no year found in filename
- Always use January 1st (`YYYY-01-01`) format - don't guess months
- Special case: `2005-2016` folder uses `2010-01-01` (middle of range)

## Content Classification Rules
- **Don't guess tags, conferences, or categories** from filenames
- Use only "presentation" category for all PDF files
- Keep original filenames intact in titles
- No automatic extraction of conference names or event details

## File Processing
- Process all PDF files in `static/YEAR/` directories
- Preserve original filename structure
- Don't attempt to clean or modify filenames beyond basic processing

## Example Date Extraction Logic
```bash
# Try to extract year from filename first
if [[ "$filename" =~ ([0-9]{4}) ]]; then
    local year="${BASH_REMATCH[1]}"
    echo "$year-01-01"
    return
fi

# Fallback: use directory year
if [[ "$year_dir" =~ ^[0-9]{4}$ ]]; then
    echo "$year_dir-01-01"
elif [[ "$year_dir" == "2005-2016" ]]; then
    echo "2010-01-01"  # Middle of range
fi
```
